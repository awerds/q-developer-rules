# Development Standards

## Code Quality and Standards

### Infrastructure as Code
- Use AWS CDK (TypeScript/Python) for new projects
- CloudFormation for existing templates
- Terraform for multi-cloud scenarios
- Version control all infrastructure code
- Implement drift detection and remediation

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Version APIs using semantic versioning
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

### Error Handling and Logging
- Implement structured logging (JSON format)
- Use correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log at appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement centralized logging with CloudWatch or ELK

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with >80% code coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Infrastructure tests using tools like Terratest
- Load testing for performance validation
- Security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### CI/CD Pipeline Standards
- Automated testing at every stage
- Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- Infrastructure validation
- Blue/green or canary deployments
- Automated rollback capabilities

### Documentation
- README files for all repositories
- API documentation (auto-generated preferred)
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for operational procedures
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Monitoring and Observability
- Implement the three pillars: metrics, logs, traces
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Set up meaningful alerts (avoid alert fatigue)
- Implement health checks for all services
- Dashboard for key business and technical metrics
