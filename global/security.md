# Security Standards

## Zero Trust Architecture

Implement "never trust, always verify" principles:

### Identity and Access Management
- Use AWS SSO/Identity Center for centralized identity management
- Implement MFA for all human users
- Use IAM roles for service-to-service communication
- Regular access reviews and principle of least privilege
- No long-term access keys - use temporary credentials

### Network Security
- Default deny all traffic, explicitly allow required connections
- Use VPC endpoints for AWS service communication
- Implement WAF for web applications
- Use Security Groups as stateful firewalls
- Network ACLs for additional subnet-level protection

### Data Protection
- Encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS
- Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2+
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for credentials and API keys
- Implement data classification and handling procedures
- Regular backup and recovery testing

### Monitoring and Compliance
- Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- Use GuardDuty for threat detection
- Implement Security Hub for centralized security findings
- Use Config Rules for compliance monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for security events

### Application Security
- Implement OWASP Top 10 protections
- Use AWS CodeGuru for security code reviews
- Implement input validation and output encoding
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Incident Response
- Documented incident response procedures
- Automated containment and remediation where possible
- Regular tabletop exercises
- Integration with AWS Systems Manager for automated response
