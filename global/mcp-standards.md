# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Standards

## Overview

MCP servers extend Q Developer's capabilities by providing access to external data sources, tools, and AWS services. This document establishes standards for MCP server selection, configuration, and usage in AWS consulting workflows.

## Essential MCP Servers for AWS Consulting

### Core AWS Infrastructure
- **AWS Knowledge MCP** - Official AWS documentation and guidance (AWS-managed)
- **AWS API MCP** - Direct AWS service interaction via CLI commands
- **AWS CDK MCP** - Infrastructure as Code with security compliance
- **AWS CloudFormation MCP** - Direct CloudFormation resource management

### Development & UI Focus
- **Playwright MCP** - Browser automation, UI testing, screenshots
- **Frontend MCP** - React and modern web development guidance
- **GitHub MCP** - Repository management and Git operations
- **Filesystem MCP** - Local file and project management

### Cost & Operations
- **AWS Cost Explorer MCP** - Cost analysis and optimization
- **AWS Pricing MCP** - Pre-deployment cost estimation
- **CloudWatch MCP** - Monitoring and operational insights

### Data & Analytics (for SaaS projects)
- **DynamoDB MCP** - NoSQL database operations
- **Aurora PostgreSQL MCP** - Relational database management
- **S3 Tables MCP** - Data lake and analytics operations

## Configuration Standards

### Security Requirements
- Store sensitive tokens in environment variables
- Use IAM roles when possible instead of access keys
- Regular token rotation (90-day maximum)
- Never commit credentials to version control

### Performance Guidelines
- Limit concurrent MCP servers to 8-10 for optimal performance
- Use local servers for development, remote for production workflows
- Configure appropriate timeouts and retry policies

### Documentation Requirements
- Document all MCP server purposes and use cases
- Maintain configuration templates for team consistency
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**: Use AWS Knowledge MCP for architecture guidance
2. **Implementation**: CDK/CloudFormation MCP for infrastructure, Playwright for UI
3. **Testing**: Playwright MCP for automated testing, GitHub MCP for CI/CD
4. **Deployment**: AWS API MCP for resource management
5. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch MCP for operational insights

### Cost Management Workflow
1. **Pre-deployment**: AWS Pricing MCP for cost estimation
2. **Post-deployment**: Cost Explorer MCP for analysis
3. **Optimization**: Regular cost reviews using MCP insights

## Best Practices

### Server Selection
- Start with essential servers (AWS Knowledge, API, CDK, Playwright, GitHub)
- Add specialized servers based on project requirements
- Avoid redundant servers that provide similar functionality

### Configuration Management
- Use version-controlled configuration files
- Implement environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- Regular configuration audits and updates

### Troubleshooting
- Enable detailed logging for MCP server interactions
- Monitor server health and response times
- Maintain fallback procedures for server failures

## Compliance & Governance

### Data Handling
- Ensure MCP servers comply with data privacy requirements
- Implement appropriate data classification and handling
- Regular security assessments of MCP server configurations

### Access Control
- Role-based access to MCP server configurations
- Audit trails for MCP server usage
- Regular access reviews and cleanup

## Updates & Maintenance

### Version Management
- Track MCP server versions and update schedules
- Test updates in development environments first
- Maintain rollback procedures for failed updates

### Performance Monitoring
- Regular performance assessments
- Capacity planning for MCP server resources
- Optimization based on usage patterns
